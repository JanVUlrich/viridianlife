## Can we go on like this?

It’s 2020 and heat records are again set all over the planet. Rainforests are being cut down at increasing rates despite decades of dire warnings and calls to action. And our oceans are being ever more rapidly depleted of life, thanks to overfishing and in no small part plastics, micro and macro. Oh and does anybody remember peak oil? Due to the receding polar ice and high-ish oil prices exploration in ever more remote territories has become feasible, pushing the peak in global oil production back a substantial amount of time.

Despite all [studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth), analyses and projections that have made headlines over the last 50 years, humans are consuming [more  natural resources](https://www.overshootday.org) than our planet could sustainably provide. Human actions have already pushed [one eighth](https://ipbes.net/news/how-did-ipbes-estimate-1-million-species-risk-extinction-globalassessment-report) of all known species on this planet close to extinction. If we do not change course, large parts of the planet will become [unable to support](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/18/climate-crisis-heat-is-on-global-heating-four-degrees-2100-change-way-we-live) orderly human civilisation. Our impacts on our ecosphere are well-known and closely monitored.

There are many individuals or NGOs that are trying to stem the tide and push for changes to reverse some of the most dire trends, but any good news is drowned out by the noise of bad news (or sociel media white noise). It is quite easy nowadays to fall into a state of resignation or apathy. And why wouldn’t we? The problems are countless and truly daunting in their scope. Time and time again, any momentum for change falters and peters out when systemic pressures and inertia („the status quo“) pose too much resistance to change. All the while existing issues become more urgent and increase in scope.

Some adopt a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle, others opt for hybrid or fully electric cars. Most still continue in their ways  though, isn’t global ecosystems decay something we elected our politicians to deal with? We’re pretty wrapped up in our own lives and daily routines to really be able to devote significant energy to contribute or – heaven forbid – start a political movement ourselves. Those who commit fully often do so at significant financial cost or even by risking to [pay](https://taz.de/RWE-klagt-auf-Schadensersatz/!5571106/) the [ultimate](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/05/environmental-activist-murders-double) [price](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-wildlife-rangers-died-duty-year.html).

## A rather vexing problem

If human society as a whole wants to not only just survive, but [thrive](https://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/about/en/) as a whole, profound and, when viewed from our current perspective, radical changes are necessary. This has been true for as long as we knew where our current trajectory will lead us, but [not much](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/mlo_full_record.png) has happened so far.

Citizens in most westernized countries (especially those in the northern hemisphere, of which the author is part of), are far removed from the consequences of their choices. Most products, tools and foods that are being consumed today are the result of a complex, opaque, global flow of goods. Most aspects of the daily lives of citizens in developed nations could not exist in their current form without globalized trade and human relations. Take for example the laptop computer this text has been written and put on the internet with: Aluminium from Australia, rare earth minerals from the Congo, plastics from chemical plants in China, all transformed into individual components in different regions in south-east Asia and finally assembled and packaged in a massive plant somewhere on the southern coast of China. All the individual parts in an electronic device might have more miles of travel in it than you could possibly stack up in your lifetime.

„But hang in there“, you might say „you’ve made solving our collective problems even harder now! How am i as a singular being supposed to tackle our global problems with so many actors involved?“ To which i’ll reply, „do not fear, as at the core of this problem also lies the solution“.

## Letting go

So what does it mean to live a sustainable life? There are, in fact, two sides to this coin: as laid out above, sustainability requires that the changes made to ones mindset and lifestyle can be maintained and are simple enough to become ingrained.
Burnout is, by definition, a result of an unsustainable lifestyle. 
Secondly, living a life that is compatible with the [permanence](https://nome.unak.is/wordpress/08-3/c69-conference-paper/responsibility-to-nature-hans-jonas-and-environmental-ethics/) of human civilisation and habitation on this planet requires that humans consume preferably fewer resources than our planet can provide. And of course, a climate suitable for human habitation couldn’t hurt, either.

All of which inevitably leads to a singular conclusion: the way we have been living until now is finished. We simply can’t continue like we currently insist on doing. This is not about a fresh coat of paint, this is about re-imagining and re-engineering. 

## Change from within

It should be sufficiently clear that the ancient adage „everything is connected“ is still, if not vastly more valid today than it has ever been. Every part of our day, from our morning cup of coffee to mindlessly watching TV in the evening, will strengthen some pathways of this global network of relationships and commodities, and cause others to weaken. Every purchase of a consumer good will have some effect on the makeup of these invisible links that connect us with humans and ecosystems in all other parts of the world. Every single decision you make – even non-action – every day, has far-reaching implications.

This is profoundly empowering. It means the any rational actor in a system (in this case, our society) can subtly change the way society works. But it implies a deep responsibility: humans are inherently social animals, we are subtly and not so subtly nudged, moved and defined by how other humans around us speak and act.

Incremental changes and adjustments, implemented with consistency and determination, will over time accumulate, compound, self-reinforce and result in substantial impacts. It’s project management 101: to get a big project done, first split it up in many small actionable chunks, which are then implemented an evaluated one after another.

And when you find yourself looking back on a year’s worth of small changes, you’ll be amazed at how much you’ve accomplished.
It does not stop there. Your actions will inspire others take action as well, either just imitating, or to find other things which they can adjust in their lives. Just as everything in this world is connected, your actions every day will have ripple effects you can not even begin to grasp.

## Profound changes and tipping points

Things change, first slowly, then suddenly and rapidly once a certain tipping point is reached.

Lasting changes in human societies can not be forced, lest the act of forcing produces a fierce backlash. Progress in society is a byproduct of gradual adjustments and slowly changing sentiments. 

[INSERT TIPPING POINTS IN SOCIETY – first slow, then fast - hockey stick]

 Humans are generally able to act one way and think another way, and maintain this cognitive dissonance for quite some time! But the tensions that inevitable emerge from this disharmonious state will make itself known soon enough, and sometimes unpleasantly so.  

Therefore the question is how not only how to live a _sustainable_ life, but to do so _sustainably_ in the long term.   The inner, personal world and the outer, living world are inevitably connected.
