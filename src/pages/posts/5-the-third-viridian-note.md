# The third viridian note
Bruce Sterling

# How this publication got its name

To recount, the initial set of principles of the viridian design movement are (were) as follows:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4.  etc

# My takeaways

There’s so much to discuss an elaborate on here. 

Not stressing about your own impact on the planet too much, instead adopting an approach that is sustainable for yourself in the first place is sane advice (and very much in line with this publication’s main thesis). Your time is limited – do not waste it by agonizing over each tiny aspect of your life.

„Planned evanescence“ is, i am afraid, as wise as it is still  ahead of its time. With most things we humans purchase, build or straight out consume, not much thought is spared about what is left behind (Pacific garbage patch, anyone?) 

Finally, just how these principles are holding up (or not) 10 years on is worth another look or two.
