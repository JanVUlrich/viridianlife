## Eating has become hard again (not for the reasons you might think)

Browsing the health section in your local bookstore (or on amazon), or even just spending 30 minutes looking at all the various health and food publications online, you’ll likely end up knowing less than what you started out with. The world is rife with opinions, prescriptions and advice regarding how and what to eat, which diets to adopt, what to buy and so on.
There are rules for certain individual nutrients („eat less salt!“ „eat more vitamin xyz“) and the demonization of whole food groups („meat is bad“ „carbohydrate is worse“ „fat is the worst!“)

There’s some evidence that the obsession with health or healthy eating is in itself not a very healthy thing. And our collective neuroses regarding what and how much to eat are certainly egged on, not reduced, by government recommendations, intense marketing pressures and the short-lived focus on single nutrients („Live longer and stronger with resveratrol!“ „Theobromine increases your happiness by 3,5%!“).

Trends and superstitions are not new, though. They have permeated human society for as long as there have been markets and cities, almost as a necessary byproduct of human tendencies towards belief and spirituality. But, as is explained here using the example of diet trends[ link to food religions ]), todays hyper-connectivity pushes once localized and benign behaviours towards the more extreme ends of the spectrum.

## What nature provided, humans accepted

Quite to the contrary, early pre-historical humans ate what nature provided, what was around them – with little knowledge or regard for macro- and micronutrients. Imagine traveling back in time, to approximately 8000 bc. You’re now embedded in a clan of hunter-gatherers, equipped with stone and wooden tools for hunting, butchering and processing of plants for medicinal or nutritional purposes. Your group has set up permanent camp in a lush river delta teeming with wild animals of all species, with wild sweet grasses and fruit available everywhere. 
Now imagine trying to maintain your modern „healthy“ lifestyle of counting calories and consciously reducing your cholesterol intake. Imagine trying to explain to a hunter-gatherer how that bone marrow that he (or she) has just wrestled from a shinbone of a recently slaughtered water buffalo is way too fatty and might help induce heart disease. You’d very quickly be made aware that not accepting what nature has to offer puts you at a severe competitive disadvantage.

Nowadays you might have more tools at your disposal – as well as some highly specialized skills – but your genetic makeup is still more or less the same as it was 8000 or more years ago. You are, genetically speaking, still a hunter-gatherer, just dressed more fancily and teeming with the signs high levels of chronic stress. There’s some evidence that hunter-gatherers lived, if they did not die during childhood, often to old age. The fossil record, but also the last remaining examples of traditional tribes support this notion. On the contrary, the majority of elderly people in western countries are kept functional by marvelous medical technology, not because our lifestyles have become healthier overall (i am not discounting of course the effectiveness of such simple habits as washing your hands regularly). 

## ANOTHER HEADLINE

So, if hunter-gatherers could do just fine without complex nutritional guidelines and the constant monitoring of which nutrients went in your body and when, why couldn’t modern humans do the same? Isn’t not having to manage your micronutrients way more sustainable than obsessing over them? If humans evolved in a multitude of environments where they simply ate what was available, why can’t we revert back this lifestyle? 

{{ insert elaboration and caveats: „why can’t we revert back“ and „emulate“ are not possible, see „nature is over“ and „problems with the paleo diet“ }}

These guidelines aim to provide a framework that encourages you to not think about (=carefully manage) your nutrition, but instead develop sustainable habits that allow you to relax and navigate the modern food system with some ease. 


## 1) Keep it natural

#### Avoid foods that are vehicles for sugar
Adding sugar to almost anything is a surefire way to make anyone overeat. If it’s sweet, it sells. Sugar production is usually subsidized, so producers are sure to make a handy profit.

#### Avoid refined cereals, industrial breads and pastries
It’s either high sugar contents or industrial yeasts and dough conditioners – all of these products are optimized for cheap production and long shelf-life, not for human consumption.

#### Avoid industrial „edible“ oils
We’re talking rapeseed, sunflower seeds, cottonseed and corn oils, as well as the two most risky ones: linseed and safflower oils. They’re little more than paint base [link to use of seed oils]. All of these will disrupt your omega 3 / 6 balance, push your body towards a more inflammatory state and create the base conditions for stiffening blood vessels. Margarine, which is made from these oils, is a completely artificial product that has no place in the human diet at all.

#### Avoid foods with made-up brand® names 
Snickers® is a copyrighted, trademarked brand and recipe for the assembly of various kinds of highly palatable sugar vehicles into a completely new product. Without modern machinery, food processing equipment and a hefty marketing budget, this product would just not be possible. Brand names and colorful plastic wrappers are usually a sign for for unhealthy, artificial contents. Another way to phrase this question would be „does it grow“: Try planting a Snickers tree, or grow an acre of Frosties plants. 

#### Avoid foods with added vitamins and minerals
This is an extension of the prior point.  If they have to add nutrients back in, it speaks to the sheer vacuity of the product.

#### Do not drink your calories 
That vanilla caramel latte with cream topping as a chaser after lunch a) probably has more caloric energy than lunch itself and b) that beverage is not coffee, despite what is advertised – it is a desert.
Yes, this particular piece of advice also rules out „bulletproof coffee“, which, as far as meal replacements go, is a pretty inadequate one. Sorry.


## 2) Keep it simple

#### Buy in bulk
All dried goods (legumes, rice, flours, ground spices) will keep well if stored in dry conditions and usually come at a volume discount – so stock up! If perishable goods are on offer, consider converting them into products that store well. For example, when there’s a deal on apples, get as many as you can carry to make and freeze apple pie, or make shelf-stable preserves like apple sauce or marmalade. If you’re feeling adventurous, try your hand at making apple cider and applejack.

#### Eat what’s in season
Consider the environmental impact of preserving, shipping and storing of out-of-season produce. Many seasonal fruits and vegetables are now available year-round thanks to an intricate global infrastructure of producers and shippers. Overseas produce is usually picked unripe and allowed to ripen while in storage, so less vitamins and nutrients are developed compared to regional, fully ripened produce. Lastly, having strawberries or pears available all year round takes most of the excitement away! Isn’t looking forward to strawberry season – and then eating as many berries as you can – a valuable thing in itself?

#### Assemble a list of simple, fire-and-forget recipes
Cooking does not have to be a chore, nor do you have to produce a michelin-grade dinner every night. Figure out your favorite go-to recipes and then find other ingredients to rotate in for some variety. 

#### Eat all the colors (the deeper, the better)
From red to yellow to green to blue, colors are a signaling mechanism not only for ripeness, but for abundant phytochemicals and adaptogens. Another way to put this would be: „eat the highest possible variety of plants and animals“. Roots, Seeds, Fruit, Nuts, Meats, Dairy, Fish, Insects – everything is on the table. No need to stress about individial nutrients, or god forbid, „superfoods“. It’s usually just marketing claims or the ebb and flow of popular trends. Food variety, sleep and sunlight go hand in hand and will cover all your bases.

#### When in doubt: Could you make it at home? 
If you couldn’t make the product in question at home with your own kitchen tools from basic ingredients, better don’t eat or buy it. That includes almost all sweets, all seed oils and margarines, as well as industrially produced breads and pastries, as mentioned above)

#### Still in doubt? Don’t eat!
Yes, not eating is a viable option, as the human body will take care of some cleaning up („autophagy“) while in a fasted state. Occasionally skipping a meal might even free up some time for you to rest or pursue a fun activity. Consult your GP before going on an extended fast, though.

#### Fewer ingredients make for easier cooking 
Think twice whether you really need that rare piece of fruit that traveled halfway around the world from the Burmese rainforest for that desert topping or chutney. Usually, four ingredients are plenty for any dish.



## 3) Keep it sustainable

#### Sustainable foods
Go for organic whenever you can. Nutrients are not a concern here; It’s about not supporting the use of pesticides, herbicides and artificial fertilizers, all of which will disrupt, damage and diminish biodiversity. Instead of going to the supermarket, find a farmers market or a local food coop to procure your staples from. Opt for foods that are produced within 100km of your residence, and if you can, try to befriend a producer / farmer from your region and see where this might lead you. 

#### Sustainable habits
Know yourself and your habits and how they might get in your way. Then optimize for ease and simplicity: apply the pareto principle whenever you can. 

#### Create self-reinforcing habits
Food tastes better in good company. Share what you’ve learned along the way, share recipes, share ideas, give back. Make sure to drink, play and decompress if and whenever possible. (Organic red wine, if available, is your best option for imbibing).
Do not stress out about hitting the mark all the time, but try to have fun along the way. Keeping a positive, relaxed outlook will help reinforcing good habits. It’s not make-or-break, but a game of lifelong learning and small, incremental improvements.


## Bonus points

#### Embrace the nasty bits 
Opt for offal (liver, kidneys, tripe etc) every now and then.  These bits are packed with essential nutrition, but usually discarded as most people favor lean muscle meat. Learn to make bone broths with other tissues rich in collagen (cartilage, skin). „Nose-to-tail-eating“ might be a buzzword at this moment, but the underlying principle – not letting go anything to waste – is timeless.

#### Eat plenty of fermented foods 
Sauerkraut, Kimchi, Kombucha (if you like tea), fermented raw dairy (yoghurt, kefir etc) real sourdough breads are tasty and health-promoting. Every traditional culture in human history has some type of fermented food or staple; A bit of research will lead you to exciting new tastes and textures.

#### If you like dairy, opt for raw or fermented dairy 
made from sheep’s or goat milk 
lucky you if you’re living in Spain, Greece or Italy!

#### Go and read everything Micheal Pollan has written
But especially: „The Omnivores Dilemma“ and „Cooked“.
