intro: In an intact ecosystem, animals and plants exist in an equilibrium, keeping each other in check. Humans have irreparably upset this balance on panet earth. Moving food production into cities and laboratories to reduce land usage and animal suffering might be the only way forward.

## First up: why eat wild?
* healthier? yes.
* More variety and more nutrients?

## The problem is in the numbers
* Comparison of wild animal biomass vs. domesticated animals vs. Humans
* How much fish is left?
* How long until there are only domesticated animals left?

* sustainable? no, —> compare number of humans vs. no. of wild animals
* Land usage for agriculture is only increasing
* There are simply too many humans on this planet
* The common narrative is „we need to feed everybody“ (this impulse is what makes us human after all)
* The tradeoff is, that if all humans were suddenly to rely on hunting and gathering, this planet would be razed and destroyed in totality whithin months
* Possible microcosm: china (already imports 20% FACT CHECK of its food as it cant feed a population of 1.4 billion)
* Humans need to figure out a way to farm fish or oceans will be emptied – and completely die

## A possible way forward
* So, the only way forward, if we want to keep our Ecosystems intact, is lab-grown everything
* Moving food production into cities and laboratories
* (Counting on human ingenuity is a safe bet)
* Soylent green, anyone? (JK ofcourse)
