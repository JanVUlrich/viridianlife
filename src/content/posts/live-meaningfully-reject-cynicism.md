# Modern cynicism is a dark place

* to complain and to mistrust is to deny change and the possibility for change

_cynicism is passively accepting the status quo_
* Not working towards change
* Not believing that things will be better or that inadequacies can be improved upon

_Cynicism is the precursor to conspiracism_ 
You’re slowly training yourself to second-guess everything: how could everything be so bad, so coherently twisted, if there weren’t bigger, darker powers at play? You’ll find that you’re unable to accept that things just are the way they are and what they are. 

* cynicism is being content with complaining

* cynicism is the forfeiture of any chance of creating the future that we’re secretly hoping will become present

* cynicism is rejecting responsibility

* cynicism is forfeiting a voice, a vote and leadership

_Cynicism is apathy and disappointment pretending to be wisdom_

_cynicism is rejecting optimism_
You’ll find yourself rejecting optimistism as unrealistic and foolish. „Everything will turn out ok!“ Yeah right, you’ll see, people never change! „I believe in the good in people“ Oh you’re so naive for not seeing behind their charade!

_For a cynic, altruism is deceitful selfishness_
And therein lies the danger of modern cynicism: it is a slippery slope towards the conclusion that behind any outwardly altruistic action (or motives signaled) lay only selfish deceit. That even people that you were supposed to be close and warm with, are actively manipulating and exploiting you by feigning interest in reciprocity – just to further their own goals.

And soon enough Murphy’s law catches up with you: while you are paying more attention to evidence of other’s deceit you’ll only find your fears and suspicions confirmed, bit by bit. And so your ever more skewed perspective inevitably pushes you to abandon warmth and closeness in your relationships, reinforcing the estrangement. 


# Finding an administering an antidote

* behave ethically, and things will turn out OK

* behave with predictability and integrity

* assume responsibility, you will grow far beyond what you could imagine for yourself

* accept that negative outcomes might happen, and practice the thought of dealing with them

* accept that many things are out of your control, but embrace those things that are not.

* learn to love everything that happens, good or bad, as these are opportunities to live, learn and grow

In Summary: do not be a cynic. Keep your head up, roll your shoulders back and stand tall. As Stoics advise: it is not events in our lives that cause us grief, but our attitude towards them. So take whatever life is throwing at you head-on, maintain your perspective and keep pushing.
